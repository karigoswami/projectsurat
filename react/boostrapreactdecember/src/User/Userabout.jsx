        <p style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Lord Krishna is not only a god, but a guide who teaches us how to live life with joy, courage, and righteousness. <br/> <br/>Radha is not just Krishna’s beloved.  <br/> <br/>she represents pure devotion, selfless love, and complete surrender. <br/>  <br/>Together, Radha and Krishna symbolize the union of the soul with the divine. <br/> <br/> <br/>

Their love is not worldly or material.it is spiritual and eternal. <br/> <br/> It teaches us that true love is based on trust, sacrifice, and devotion, not on selfish desires.  <br/> <br/>Radha’s devotion shows us that when love is pure, God resides in the heart of the devotee.

Lord Krishna, through the Bhagavad Gita, teaches us:

“Do your duty without attachment to the results.”

And Radha teaches us:

“True love asks for nothing in return.”

In today’s fast-paced world, the message of Radha–Krishna inspires us to live with peace, compassion, patience, and faith. If we follow their teachings, our lives can become more meaningful and joyful.

To conclude, I would like to say:
Where there is Krishna, there is wisdom;
where there is Radha, there is devotion;
and where there is Radha and Krishna together, there is divine love.

 <br/> <br/>
Radhe Radhe 🙏 <br/>
Jai Shri Krishna 🌼</p>
